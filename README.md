👋 Hi, I’m Chenrui Wang (王晨瑞)

I’m a recent graduate from the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE), where I majored in Statistics in the Experimental Class of the School of Statistics and Management. In Fall 2025, I will begin my Master’s studies in Applied Statistics at Renmin University of China.

🔬 Research Interests

I’m passionate about statistical computing, optimization algorithms, machine learning and deeplearning. My recent work focuses on optimal transport and large language models (LLMs), combining rigorous theoretical analysis with practical implementation.

📌 Featured Projects

	•ICML 2025 Paper (Accepted): Developed a new quasi-Newton method for entropic-regularized optimal transport combining Hessian sparsification and low-rank approximation. The method ensures fast convergence and theoretical guarantees.
	•StatChat: Statistics-Focused LLM: Led fine-tuning and evaluation of a domain-specific LLM. Achieved a +3.5% accuracy improvement on the FinEval dataset.
	•Mathematical Modeling Competition (Captain): Built numerical models and visualizations for multibeam sonar systems. Won second prize in Shanghai.
	•Social Sentiment Analysis Project: Designed a BERT-based pipeline to analyze regional sentiment on parking issues using crawled Weibo data.

🛠 Tech Stack

	•Languages: Python, C, C++, R, LaTeX
	•Tools: PyTorch, HuggingFace, LLaMA-Factory, MATLAB

🏆 Achievements

	•Ranked Top 6% in cohort (GPA: 3.67/4.0)
	•First Prize, People’s Scholarship
	•Provincial awards in both Mathematical Modeling and Mathematics Competitions
